    <h2>Brief</h2>
    <p>The brief for this project is to create a database to attach to our website. We have previously built the foundations of a website and 
        to develop the complexity we have to be able to manage running a database and connect it with the website. Alongside other heads of pride groups in wellington
        we have started an orgnaisation called Wellington queer students association to help connect and share ideas with queer youth in the greater Wellington region. 
        Since I am head of social media to advertise and help organise I have decided to create a website for WQSA.

        <h2>Sprint one</h2>
    <hr>
        <h4>Plan</h4>
            <p>For the first sprint of my database, I need to make a feature where you can become a website member and have a news page to print out important news relating to the website. I will first need to make the databases for the members and the news table. Then I will make some queries for each table and then I will move onto focusing on the front end for both the member table and the news table. 
            This means you can access certain parts of the website but not others. This would include being able to write comments on the news page but not having access to add news or delete them. I will confirm the details with them first. They will also need to enter their credentials and password for the site. Then I need to add the login feature for the members so that it checks their authorisation so they can have access to what they should. 
            I need to create a new page to keep up to date with news that is going on to do with WQSA. The news page will be a separate database but will connect to the members database through the member id. This is important because I want each news item to print out the corresponding member name connected with each member id. This means that people can see who made the news article. 
            The news page also needs to have a date and be in chronological order to make sure you can see the most recent news at the top of the page. The database needs to include the title, subtitle, content, name of the person who posted it and the date it was published. </p>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>Overall this sprint has its challenges but it was a basic start for the database. Adding the confirm details posed a few problems in this sprint because it took you to a separate page and then there you have to confirm, delete, or submit and then from there you have to post it. However, what I had was it was posted after the first one and not after the confirm page and then I sorted it out. 
                I didn’t have too much trouble with this first sprint it was mainly the confirm page that caused issues. This was because the confirm page wasn’t originally posting after the page it was posting to the database at the original sign up and I had to work out connecting the front end of the code to the members table itself. I figured out I had to just insert into the database from my server page using sql code and putting the authorisation automatically to one if you sign up from the website. 
                It was the first part so it was the sprint where I learnt how to connect the database to the website and how to make the actual database. You need to get the back end of the database to work originally before you connect it to the front part of the website. When I added news I had to take myself to a different page which was a little tricky to make sure it posted correctly to the news page. I also had to make sure that the date worked and was the correct time. 
            I also added a reset button when you are adding news so this takes the user back to a blank copy and wipes the information. Then I also added delete and update buttons to the individual news items and I changed the styling to make it grey instead of blue because I felt that style of button worked better for my website. You can only access the add, update, and delete buttons if you have no authorisation which means you are someone who runs the site. You can’t access it if you are a member who just signed up. 
                This was a time-consuming sprint though because making sure that everything was working and connecting was a little tricky. Since it is still reasonably early into the databases I was learning how to do everything and the differences between the back end and front end of the database connected with the website. This sprint was the first one and I completed a lot because these are the foundations of the database and they are the two bigger tables than the rest of mine that I have planned. 
            I remember doing queries from last year so I was familiar of the layout and how to do them so it didn’t cause that much confusion. However, it still was new for me to do it on pycharm so connecting the database all together and to the db functions was new for me and understanding the layout of databases and the program. Overall this sprint was time-consuming but it was a really good beginning for the rest of my database and I enjoyed learning more about databases again. </p>

        <h2>Sprint two</h2>
    <hr>
        <h4>Plan</h4>
            <p>To start this sprint I wanted to get the sessions going. So this is where you have the ability to sign in and out of the website if you have already signed up through the Get Involved page. There also needs to be a visual reminder at the top of the screen when they sign in just to show to them who is signed in, their authorisation and their member id. The authorisation can remind them what they can and can’t have access to and this will be especially relevant in this sprint because I am also adding comments to the news items. 
                The people that can access comments can be members who sign up to the site so that is something extra they can do if they sign up. These are the people whose authorisation is 1 because they can access certain things like adding comments but not other things like adding the actual news items. I also have to make sure that the comments line up with the specific news item and not just down the page randomly. Since I need the member and news id this means I need to have an association table in the database. 
                To have an association table I need the id of the comments table which will be a primary key, then I will also need the member id and the news id in the comments table. These will be foreign keys in my database. </p>

    <hr>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>For the login page, I created a separate file for it and a button on the right side next to the get involved. The login page is a simple form that asks for the users email and password and then checks the database to see if there is a member with those details. If there is then it logs in and shows the user a visual cue by having it at the top of the site saying who is logged in and their authorisation details. 
                An association table was necessary for what I wanted to achieve for the comments section because I wanted the comments to connect to the correct news id and also have the member who wrote the comment print out as well alongside the time and content of the comment. Overall it was a little tricky to work out making sure that the news id connected with the comments id because in the first code I did the comments just printed on the side. But with a bit of guidance from my dad, I did manage to find out how to do it. 
                This was by choosing to put comments on the same file as the news was the first step because they were being printed on the same page. Then I put all of the comments' content in a for loop and the first thing was checking if the news and the comments id were = then it would print the comment and it would print the content, date, and the member who made the comment. Then to make actual comments on the file I had to start off by checking the session authorisation first because the adding comments will only appear on screen with the correct authorisation. 
                Then it was just doing a form for the comments which was similar to the one I did for the news. You can still see the comments when you aren’t logged in but you are unable to add another comment. I tested this and you can see a photo above of making sure the comments were posted to the main page when I was adding the comments. When I worked with association tables last year it was a little different because all I was putting in them was the primary key from the two tables and then connected them together through that way. 
                However, this year was different because I had to have other content on the database because it was printing out actual comments. Once you have signed in then you can have access to the comments which is something else i did during this sprint. </p>

            <p>This is my final sprint and I need to add an events page to make sure people are up to date with events happening. The format will be very similar to what we did for the news page where there will be articles in a list in chronological order. However, for the news page I take the users to a separate page when I am adding, deleting or updating news items and I do not want a separate page for this. I want to have the add feature on the actual page and not take them to a separate page and have the delete button on next to the event that I want to delete. 
                I also want to just clean up everything and make sure that everything is running properly because it is the last sprint so everything needs to be tidy and running correctly. I also have an email sign up on my main page but it isn’t connected to a database so I want to create a table for it and have anyone be able to just put their email address in and then they will sign up for a newsletter or emails from the website. This means they don’t need to make an actual account to the website but they need to just put in their email. 
                This will be a separate table that isn’t connected to anything else because it isn’t something to print on the website where people can make updates to anything. </p>

            <p>Then this is the code all working again</p>
    <hr>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>Overall this was reasonably easy to implement because it was pretty similar to the news code that I did. I did have a bit of trouble with the formatting because since I had comments on the news page I had to have different formatting than the events page because it is just all across page. I did this by not doing div class="col-lg-8" which I had for my news page because the page had to have the correct spacing for the comments to fit next to the correct news item. 
                This was my final sprint and since I am near the end of this internal then I understand database more and it I understood it more so I could do it quicker. Especially because I did it soon after the news sprint I began to understand it a lot more and the connection between the back end of the website which is the database part compared to the HTML which is the front end. However, something different on the events page is that if you want to add events on the page it is just a form on the original page. 
                This was just easier to do and less hassle than taking them to a separate form page. It also only has the title and then the content because I felt that an event just needs a title and then a description. It is in chronological order of when it is posted similar to the news page. The form will also only come up for members with the authorization of 0 which is people associated to the site. Then the email was reasonably straightforward. I forgot to do some little things like dropping the table but was fixed easily. 
                Then I had an error where the form wasn’t actually posting to the database and it was doing nothing when I checked the inspect page and this was because I did not drop the table. Then I found another error and in my server it was showing up as immutableMultiDict error and it was empty. I fixed this by on my server page I put a comma next to the email to show the code that I didn’t want it to put in everything on that line but just the email. This was a small fix but it was tricky to work out since it was just putting in a comma. However, once I fixed it everything was working fine and showing up in the database. </p>

    <h2>Sprint four</h2>
<hr>
    <h4>Plan</h4>
        <p> The plan for this sprint is to test my code to make sure that it is all working correctly and see if I can find any errors. I know that my member page needs a bit of work and that it is not working if I put in an email that already exists. There are also some issues with my confirm page and where it was not correctly posting to the database that I noticed earlier and will be addressing in this sprint. </p>

                <h5>Testing</h5>
                <div class="col-md-12 my-2">
                    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block my-2" src="Photos/Errors/member_testing/passing_empty_values.png"> </div>
                </div>
                <p>This was the error that I recieved because I was passing empty values through the confirm page</p>
                <div class="col-md-12 my-2">
                    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block my-2" src="Photos/Errors/member_testing/input_confirm.png"> </div>
                </div>
                <p>Then to put it I put in input tags on my confrm page because they were previously just variables</p>
                <div class="col-md-12 my-2">
                    <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block my-2" src="Photos/Errors/member_testing/fixed_code.png"> </div>
                </div>
                <p>Then this is a second check to see if we have inputs in it, if the response in the databse doesn't = true then display the error page and if it does
                    then all is well and you can see this in the code in the line if 'confirm' in f and f['confirm'] == 'true' and 'name' in f and 'email' in f and 'password' in f:
                    
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>Then when a user used the same email as a member already in the database this is what came up that is seen in the first image
                    so I made a better error message for the users.

                </div>
                <p>I got the integrity error because I was checking to se if a string exists within the object tpe integrity error which wasn't supported because it wasn't a strng so I conversted it into a string</p>

                </div>
                <p>checking database to see if it works and it posted and all works well</p>
<hr>
                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <p>This was something that I needed to do so it was good that I got around to doing it. After I posted the original template from get involved page it took the user to the confirm template that I had made. In that template, I was building a new form but I didn’t have the values as input tags I was only printing the items as variables that were displayed on the page. 
                    So when I posted back using the confirm template the only input that was getting passed through was confirm and the details from the user which should have been name, email, and password. To fix this I changed the table printing the values to input tags instead of plain variables. 
                    I also changed them to be read-only so they could not be edited on the confirm page but there was still an edit button I had previously added to take you back to the main get involved page. Also, something I found to be an error was printing the password and for security reasons, I covered that when I took the user to the confirm page so they could only see dots and not their password. </p>
                    <p>Another issue I had after confirming was if the sql insert failed to pick up the error it wouldn’t tell the user the issue it would just not post and send them back to the index page. This was because I was checking for just the result and not if the result = true. To fix this the result was already set to true for successful but if the result wasn’t true then I took them to an error page to tell the user the issue. 
                        I also added a check based on the error based on the error based on if the email address already exists then I returned an error message that made more sense to users pointing out that the email address was already existing in the database. By changing the error in the db_finctions to return as a string then I can use if string in result as the result being returned as a string instead of the object type of integrity error. 
                        I was not familiar with this error so my dad talked to me about what it is and what it means. Overall this sprint was just a bit of cleaning up previous code that didn’t work how I wanted it to work and was just fixing some small errors and adding in some validation. And putting the input stage on confirm fixed the two errors. </p>


            <hr>
            <h3>Relevant implications</h3>
            <hr>
            <h5>Intellectual propety</h5>
            <p>In this internal I have addressed intellectual property by writing my own code throughout creating databases. I received some guidance from my dad about how to achieve the comments sprint but it was all still my own work and he just advised me on some structure about what to do. 
                All of the work I have done was produced by me after getting some base knowledge from Mr Khouri about how to construct a database. Since we did databases last year I already had prior knowledge about them but it was more connecting it to the website which I needed advice on but it is all written and created by me. 
            All of the planning work was also all done by me and it wasn't anyone elses work. 
            </p>

            <h5>Accessability</h5>
            <p>I have addressed website accessibility in this project because the majority of my font sizes are bigger size. There aren’t huge blocks of text that people could find hard to read and understand. If there are bigger parts of text they are in a bigger font so it isn’t much writing it’s just bigger.
                This font is also easier for people to read. I also have a navigation bar which is typical in websites so it will be easy for users to navigate around the website because none of it is in tech language. It is all in colours that people can read, either in black or white depending on which colour the box is. The navigation bar is clear the page links are on one side and the sign-in and log in are on the right-hand side which they typically are in websites so it is familiar with the users. 

            </p>
            <h5>Aesthetics</h5>
            <p>I have addressed the aesthetics and relevant implications throughout this project by making the website look aesthetically pleasing for the type of people that will be going onto this website. Since it is for a Wellington queer youth association I made sure to style my website with lots of different colours, especially on the home page because each box has a separate colour and it goes down according to the rainbow. 
                I have also put colourful pictures in there to add to the website theme. I have put the main picture up the top a photo I took of all the flags which is relevant for my website and is a nice basic picture. I also tried to incorporate rainbows where I could when styling the website including the buttons on the Meet the Team page so paying attention to detail during this was important.
            </p>
            <h5>Future-proofing</h5>
            <p>I addressed this in my databases internal because I have commented throughout my code where I feel commenting is necessary. I did comment on my layout file because there are lots of elements and I made it clear if someone was to look at my code and understand it at a future time. I have a lot of different files and they are all in the same folder under templates and names correctly which corresponds to what file it is taking it to.
                This means it is much easier to find the file if someone wants to add to it in the future or if it came across errors it is easier to find. I have comments all throughout the files on my database just to say what each file is for and more on the news page because there are multiple different elements running from that file. 
            </p>
            <h5>Functionality</h5>
            <p>I have addressed this in my databases by making sure that everything works in my code and is connected to a database. This was especially relevant in my email database because I added in the code originally when creating my website and it was purely just there for aesthetic reasons.
                Then I remembered it was thereafter creating my other databases and linking the code on the front side to a database so it does do something. All of my databases work and if a user adds news or comments they appear on the website as well as in the database so we can see all of their additions.
