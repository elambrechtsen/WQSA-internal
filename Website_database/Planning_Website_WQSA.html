        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p>
            The brief for this project is to make a website using Pycharm for a topic of our choice. I choose to do this project about Wellington Queer Students Association or WQSA for short. This website will use Flask (a Python webserver), and Bootstrap 5 to provide styling in the html or the <i>front</i> side of the website. Then making sure the website was functional was important for me so there was a database connected to the back end.<br/>
            For the database, I used SQLite on Flask to build the back end of the website. The database has multiple tables for members, events and news the members create as the last table is for people to supply their email addresses if they want to get involved.<br/>
            The member table is also used for logging into the website as it holds the member's password. Wellington Queer Students Association was started up this year which is why I found the need for there to be a website for it. They wanted a place where anyone could access it and find all the information they needed about WQSA. Since it was started up this year it was at the most crucial part of putting its name out there and advertising itself. Then the final stage of this internal is making the site live.

        <h2>Relevant implications</h2>
        <h3>Intellectual property</h3>
        <p>
            Intellectual property is important because it means that all the work you are producing is done by you and you aren't stealing someone else's code. This is particularly relevant in the digital age because there can be confusion around who owns the code and copyright to it. This internal I just need to make sure that all of the code I write myself and if I get some help to credit that I got some guidance on this sprint.
        </p>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
            Website accessibility is making sure that the website is accessible to a range of people. This includes making sure that the font size isn't too small. They are ensuring that people understand the website and if there are errors the user can understand why that happened and how to fix it. Another component which is also I also need to be aware of is making sure there isn't a lot of text that some users could find it difficult to read. Also to make the website easy to understand so people who may struggle with technology can understand or just make it as easy for the user as possible to know where to find the information that they want.
        </p>

        <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
        <p>
            The aesthetics of a website is very important because it is the basis of the website itself. Aesthetics is making sure that the website looks appealing to the user on it so they continue to use the website. This is important when you use a website for commercial use because it is dependent on what the client wants and fits their needs. You need to make a website that is for the target audience for example mine is for WQSA so I have to put lots of colour on it and tailor it to the needs of the people that would be viewing the site. Be careful that there isn't big walls of text which makes it hard for users to read so it prevents them from going back to the site in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>Future-proofing</h3>
        <p>
            Sustainability and future-proofing guarantee that I have properly commented my code and made it clear which function is fonig what. This is so I could go back and look at previous code I have written and understand what is meant to happen and what I was writing. As well as that it is also if someone else were to look at my code they would understand how it works and be able to give to another developer and they understand it quickly. This means that everything should be appropriately commented on before important functions/code and that the different files are names correctly. This relevant implication is also for if I could add new features and/or functions to the code easily and I would not have to alter previous code at all or too much to add in new functionality for this code.
        </p>

        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of this relevant implication is to make sure that the code actually works. That I have all my validation in where it is needed to be and it actually works and is function for a database connecting to my WQSA website. In order to do this you have to make sure that my the ordering system does not crash. I need to make sure that the program has no bugs or faults so it runs smoothly and doesn't crash. It did not do incorrect maths when adding up the subtotals or the overall total of the order. All items added to the separate lists e.g. tables will reset if the user requests to run again; all databases need to be emptied if the server is stopped and started again.

        <h2 id="sprint_one_website">Sprint One - Website</h2>
        <h3>Brief</h3>
        <p>
            This is the start of me building the site and putting down the foundations of the site. The goal for this sprint is to create my index page with the content on it after I have planned it. I want to make an image for the main site that is related to WQSA. It's my first sprint of the whole project so I putting down the structure of what I am working on and getting my head around Bootstrap5. This is something I have never worked with before so I want to properly understand how to use the framework so I can incorporate it into the website.<br/>
            After the brainstorming that I did previously, I want to use those ideas on my website. The main elements is the home page, putting a navigation bar, doing a header image at the top of the page, writing a blurb and putting the logo next to it, doing a carousel of images, and lastly a footer at the bottom of the page.<br/>
            I also have to start off this site by testing it first and doing some trials to figure out how to do it before I start with WQSA. I started with a theme of pasta and did it about a website

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            Overall it was a good start to my website and I got down the main content that I wanted to get. This sprint consisted of me setting up my git repository for this internal and pushing my Wellington Queer Students Association folder up to GitHub. Then I also put down a main basic image for the header of my website and I had taken this photo earlier on in the year when I was at a pride event. The dimensions weren't quite right so I put the photo into Illustrator to change the sizing of the image and the file. I originally had the text coloured white and put it in the middle of the photo of the flags.<br/>
            After talking with James who is an executive in WQSA, he said that it would be beneficial to put something behind the text because it was a little busy. He also emphasised that the site needed some more colour in it because I currently have plain white boxes. This gave me the idea to put the ovals behind the Wellington Queer Students Association name and coloured each colour of the rainbow to fix both problems. I fixed this in Illustrator, similarly to how I fixed the size of the image to crop it.<br/>
            The carousel was also something that I had a few troubles with this sprint because I had to properly use the Bootstrap 5 carousel which was giving me some trouble because the formatting with the photos wasn't working correctly in the container that I had. To solve this I did some more research about carousels and was looking at w3 schools and stack overflow and looking into how other people had similar issues and resolved the problems they had. I eventually found the solution to find I wasn't using the proper version of Bootstrap and put in Bootstrap 5, then with some trial and error I worked out the formatting.

        <h2 id="sprint_two_website">Sprint Two</h2>
        <h3>Brief</h3>
        <p>
            This will be me creating different pages on my site. I have got a lot of content on my main page and I have planned my different pages for the site to take me to and have put pictures to associate them to the different pages on my home page otherwise known as my index page. Then I have to split them into different pages and have a layout for each site where I have the main picture that I have for the main page but on all the pages to keep some consistency in my work. I want to start adding in some more styling in this sprint because I currently have plain white boxes and think since the theme is about Wellington Queer Youth Association I should be adding more colour to the website to fit the brief.<br/>
            I have to have a basic layout for each page to have a theme for the website so it is more soothing to the eyes of the user. After talking to Abbie who is one of the executives she informed me that she loves the colours that I had in the main picture and I should use similar colours for the rest of the website. She liked the blurb and the carousel and thought that the entire website should be more colourful and the colours in the photos looked bland compared to the rest of the website styling.

        <p>Photo of button</p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Then I started to work on the meet the team page and the formatting wasn't working correctly but after putting it into columns it worked out. I also put the colours on the boxes that I have throughout the page
        </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            During this sprint, I made the navigation bar functional so that when you click on the different buttons is on a separate page which is something I have never done before. It was cool to learn because on previous websites I have had all my content on the same page and you scroll down but with this, it was separated into different files. All of my files are in my templates folder which are html files that then connect to the main server python file. I also started doing the styling in this sprint because previously the styling I had was minimal.<br/>
            I took inspiration from Abbie when she mentioned liking the colours from the title, and maybe I should make each box on the main page a separate colour to make it more interesting. Since I needed to use six colours, I already had the correct amount of text boxes to use for the colours so in my CSS I put in different colours that were similar to those I used in Illustrator for the different boxes. This then created a subtle rainbow look to the website. It was a simple way to bring in more colour and cater more towards the client's wishes.<br/>
            I then started to work on the “Meet the Team” page. On this page, I had photos and bios for each executive of Wellington Queer Students Association. I used a card template using Bootstrap 5 to put in a stylistic way to present the data. To continue the theme of the rainbow colours I had before I put in the same colours from the CSS I previously used and used them for the buttons on the click to see their profile buttons.<br/>
            The buttons currently don't go anywhere and their blurb is written above the buttons but that can be an error I fix in the end sprint where I go through and work out the small details. I had to put all the photos for the cards into Illustrator as well because I had to make sure that all the photos were the same size. This is because the aesthetics of the website is a big component and paying attention to small details is important so I put a basic template of a size in and then they all were formatted nicely. This sprint was rewarding because I could see the effects of the work I was doing since I was focusing more on the aesthetics of my website and less on getting the fundamentals of the site down.

        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p>
            The brief for this project is to create a database to attach to our website. We have previously built the foundations of a website and to develop the complexity we have to be able to manage running a database and connect it with the website. Alongside other heads of pride groups in wellington we have started an orgnaisation called Wellington queer students association to help connect and share ideas with queer youth in the greater Wellington region. Since I am head of social media to advertise and help organise I have decided to create a website for WQSA.

        <h4>Plan</h4>
        <p>
            For the first sprint of my database, I need to make a feature where you can become a website member and have a news page to print out important news relating to the website. I will first need to make the databases for the members and the news table. Then I will make some queries for each table and then I will move onto focusing on the front end for both the member table and the news table.<br/>
            This means you can access certain parts of the website but not others. This would include being able to write comments on the news page but not having access to add news or delete them. I will confirm the details with them first. They will also need to enter their credentials and password for the site. Then I need to add the login feature for the members so that it checks their authorisation so they can have access to what they should.<br/>
            I need to create a new page to keep up to date with news that is going on to do with WQSA. The news page will be a separate database but will connect to the members database through the member id. This is important because I want each news item to print out the corresponding member name connected with each member id. This means that people can see who made the news article.<br/>
            The news page also needs to have a date and be in chronological order to make sure you can see the most recent news at the top of the page. The database needs to include the title, subtitle, content, name of the person who posted it and the date it was published.

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
            Overall this sprint has its challenges but it was a basic start for the database. Adding the confirm details posed a few problems in this sprint because it took you to a separate page and then there you have to confirm, delete, or submit and then from there you have to post it. However, what I had was it was posted after the first one and not after the confirm page and then I sorted it out.<br/>
            I didn't have too much trouble with this first sprint it was mainly the confirm page that caused issues. This was because the confirm page wasn't originally posting after the page it was posting to the database at the original sign up and I had to work out connecting the front end of the code to the members table itself. I figured out I had to just insert into the database from my server page using sql code and putting the authorisation automatically to one if you sign up from the website.<br/>
            It was the first part so it was the sprint where I learnt how to connect the database to the website and how to make the actual database. You need to get the back end of the database to work originally before you connect it to the front part of the website. When I added news I had to take myself to a different page which was a little tricky to make sure it posted correctly to the news page. I also had to make sure that the date worked and was the correct time.<br/>
            I also added a reset button when you are adding news so this takes the user back to a blank copy and wipes the information. Then I also added delete and update buttons to the individual news items and I changed the styling to make it grey instead of blue because I felt that style of button worked better for my website. You can only access the add, update, and delete buttons if you have no authorisation which means you are someone who runs the site. You can't access it if you are a member who just signed up.<br/>
            This was a time-consuming sprint though because making sure that everything was working and connecting was a little tricky. Since it is still reasonably early into the databases I was learning how to do everything and the differences between the back end and front end of the database connected with the website. This sprint was the first one and I completed a lot because these are the foundations of the database and they are the two bigger tables than the rest of mine that I have planned.<br/>
            I remember doing queries from last year so I was familiar of the layout and how to do them so it didn't cause that much confusion. However, it still was new for me to do it on pycharm so connecting the database all together and to the db functions was new for me and understanding the layout of databases and the program. Overall this sprint was time-consuming but it was a really good beginning for the rest of my database and I enjoyed learning more about databases again.

        <h4>Plan</h4>
        <p>
            To start this sprint I wanted to get the sessions going. So this is where you have the ability to sign in and out of the website if you have already signed up through the Get Involved page. There also needs to be a visual reminder at the top of the screen when they sign in just to show to them who is signed in, their authorisation and their member id. The authorisation can remind them what they can and can't have access to and this will be especially relevant in this sprint because I am also adding comments to the news items.<br/>
            The people that can access comments can be members who sign up to the site so that is something extra they can do if they sign up. These are the people whose authorisation is 1 because they can access certain things like adding comments but not other things like adding the actual news items. I also have to make sure that the comments line up with the specific news item and not just down the page randomly. Since I need the member and news id this means I need to have an association table in the database.<br/>
            To have an association table I need the id of the comments table which will be a primary key, then I will also need the member id and the news id in the comments table. These will be foreign keys in my database.

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
            For the login page, I created a separate file for it and a button on the right side next to the get involved. The login page is a simple form that asks for the users email and password and then checks the database to see if there is a member with those details. If there is then it logs in and shows the user a visual cue by having it at the top of the site saying who is logged in and their authorisation details.<br/>
            An association table was necessary for what I wanted to achieve for the comments section because I wanted the comments to connect to the correct news id and also have the member who wrote the comment print out as well alongside the time and content of the comment. Overall it was a little tricky to work out making sure that the news id connected with the comments id because in the first code I did the comments just printed on the side. But with a bit of guidance from my dad, I did manage to find out how to do it.<br/>
            This was by choosing to put comments on the same file as the news was the first step because they were being printed on the same page. Then I put all of the comments' content in a for loop and the first thing was checking if the news and the comments id were = then it would print the comment and it would print the content, date, and the member who made the comment. Then to make actual comments on the file I had to start off by checking the session authorisation first because the adding comments will only appear on screen with the correct authorisation.<br/>
            Then it was just doing a form for the comments which was similar to the one I did for the news. You can still see the comments when you aren't logged in but you are unable to add another comment. I tested this and you can see a photo above of making sure the comments were posted to the main page when I was adding the comments. When I worked with association tables last year it was a little different because all I was putting in them was the primary key from the two tables and then connected them together through that way.<br/>
            However, this year was different because I had to have other content on the database because it was printing out actual comments. Once you have signed in then you can have access to the comments which is something else i did during this sprint.

        <h4>Plan</h4>
        <p>
            This is my final sprint and I need to add an events page to make sure people are up to date with events happening. The format will be very similar to what we did for the news page where there will be articles in a list in chronological order. However, for the news page I take the users to a separate page when I am adding, deleting or updating news items and I do not want a separate page for this. I want to have the add feature on the actual page and not take them to a separate page and have the delete button on next to the event that I want to delete.<br/>
            I also want to just clean up everything and make sure that everything is running properly because it is the last sprint so everything needs to be tidy and running correctly. I also have an email sign up on my main page but it isn't connected to a database so I want to create a table for it and have anyone be able to just put their email address in and then they will sign up for a newsletter or emails from the website. This means they don't need to make an actual account to the website but they need to just put in their email.<br/>
            This will be a separate table that isn't connected to anything else because it isn't something to print on the website where people can make updates to anything.

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
            Overall this was reasonably easy to implement because it was pretty similar to the news code that I did. I did have a bit of trouble with the formatting because since I had comments on the news page I had to have different formatting than the events page because it is just all across page. I did this by not doing div class="col-lg-8" which I had for my news page because the page had to have the correct spacing for the comments to fit next to the correct news item.<br/> 
            This was my final sprint and since I am near the end of this internal then I understand database more and it I understood it more so I could do it quicker. Especially because I did it soon after the news sprint I began to understand it a lot more and the connection between the back end of the website which is the database part compared to the HTML which is the front end. However, something different on the events page is that if you want to add events on the page it is just a form on the original page.<br/>
            This was just easier to do and less hassle than taking them to a separate form page. It also only has the title and then the content because I felt that an event just needs a title and then a description. It is in chronological order of when it is posted similar to the news page. The form will also only come up for members with the authorization of 0 which is people associated to the site. Then the email was reasonably straightforward. I forgot to do some little things like dropping the table but was fixed easily.<br/>
            Then I had an error where the form wasn't actually posting to the database and it was doing nothing when I checked the inspect page and this was because I did not drop the table. Then I found another error and in my server it was showing up as immutableMultiDict error and it was empty. I fixed this by on my server page I put a comma next to the email to show the code that I didn't want it to put in everything on that line but just the email. This was a small fix but it was tricky to work out since it was just putting in a comma. However, once I fixed it everything was working fine and showing up in the database.

            The plan for this sprint is to test my code to make sure that it is all working correctly and see if I can find any errors. I know that my member page needs a bit of work and that it is not working if I put in an email that already exists. There are also some issues with my confirm page and where it was not correctly posting to the database that I noticed earlier and will be addressing in this sprint.

            Then this is a second check to see if we have inputs in it, if the response in the databse doesn't = true then display the error page and if it does then all is well and you can see this in the code in the line if 'confirm' in f and f['confirm'] == 'true' and 'name' in f and 'email' in f and 'password' in f:

            Then when a user used the same email as a member already in the database this is what came up that is seen in the first image so I made a better error message for the users.

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
            This was something that I needed to do so it was good that I got around to doing it. After I posted the original template from get involved page it took the user to the confirm template that I had made. In that template, I was building a new form but I didn't have the values as input tags I was only printing the items as variables that were displayed on the page.<br/>
            So when I posted back using the confirm template the only input that was getting passed through was confirm and the details from the user which should have been name, email, and password. To fix this I changed the table printing the values to input tags instead of plain variables.<br/>
            I also changed them to be read-only so they could not be edited on the confirm page but there was still an edit button I had previously added to take you back to the main get involved page. Also, something I found to be an error was printing the password and for security reasons, I covered that when I took the user to the confirm page so they could only see dots and not their password.<br/>
            Another issue I had after confirming was if the sql insert failed to pick up the error it wouldn't tell the user the issue it would just not post and send them back to the index page. This was because I was checking for just the result and not if the result = true. To fix this the result was already set to true for successful but if the result wasn't true then I took them to an error page to tell the user the issue.<br/>
            I also added a check based on the error based on the error based on if the email address already exists then I returned an error message that made more sense to users pointing out that the email address was already existing in the database. By changing the error in the db_finctions to return as a string then I can use if string in result as the result being returned as a string instead of the object type of integrity error.<br/>
            I was not familiar with this error so my dad talked to me about what it is and what it means. Overall this sprint was just a bit of cleaning up previous code that didn't work how I wanted it to work and was just fixing some small errors and adding in some validation. And putting the input stage on confirm fixed the two errors.

        <h2 id="sprint_three_website"><b>Website - Sprint Three</b></h2>
        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p>
            For this sprint, I want to fix up all the errors and clean my website. This is where I want to pay attention to the little details I hadn't before I moved onto databases before I could finish the details of the front side of the site. Since so many components of the front side of the website were dependent on the database code I had to move on to building the database.<br/>
            The main part of this sprint will be fixing my images on the main page that are associated with the separate pages in the orange box. The headings are currently below the pictures and I want to fix it where they are on top of the pictures and then if you click on it then it can link to the different pages that correspond to the image and heading.<br/>
            I also want to style the events more because it currently doesn't have much styling and it looks out of place in relation to the rest of the site since the rest of the site is so colourful and this isn't. The other main section I want to focus on is the meet the team and making the buttons functional so that when you click it the bios appear and are not already written there.<br/>
            The spacing between the cards also needs some work because I originally had six but now I have five so I need to sort out the spacing for that. Then resolving small errors or adding little things to make it look better. Since it is the final sprint I just need to ensure everything is working correctly and formatted the way I want it to. Then testing on different screens and seeing if it stays the same.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            I had some trouble with the formatting of the meet the team cards which was a bootstrap function. For the meet the team section there are three cards in the top row, and then there are three in the bottom row. So I did the collum lg-4 for the bottom row since there were three cards and then for the top one since there were two I did col-lg-6 which would add up to 12. However, when I tried to do it the cards weren't centred so the spacing was off since they were in in the right sections but the cards weren't centred in the sections so the left card was skewed to the left and looked odd. Then after some research into how to centre the cards and how to fix it, I figured out that I had incorrect formatting and I found the way which was put into my class in the row div tag.<br/>
            This then formatted the way I wanted it to look and made it so the two cards in the top row which are for the president and vice president are up the top and in between the three cards in the bottom row. The two cards are in between the spaces for the three cards down the bottom which is aesthetically pleasing and I moved the presidents to the top which is easier for the user to understand. I also did the drop-down button for the cards so you can click it and see the profile so the user can seek the information if they want it.<br/>
            This makes it easier for the user, especially when looking at the client profile of Liliana this is the way she likes her information given to her. I also changed the style of the session indicator at the top of the page when someone logs in. I originally had it as a purple colour because I was just testing it and making sure it worked but I wasn't happy with the look so wanted to change it. I used a toast format which is in Bootstrap 5 to style it nicely, similar to the one that I have at the top of my index page. This is up the top left of my page and is in a clean box which is a nicer format and just a small detail.

        <h2>Relevant implications</h2>
        <hr>
        <h5>Intellectual propety</h5>
        <p>
            In this internal I have addressed intellectual property by writing my own code throughout creating databases. I received some guidance from my dad about how to achieve the comments sprint but it was all still my own work and he just advised me on some structure about what to do.<br/>
            All of the work I have done was produced by me after getting some base knowledge from Mr Khouri about how to construct a database. Since we did databases last year I already had prior knowledge about them but it was more connecting it to the website which I needed advice on but it is all written and created by me.<br/>
            All of the planning work was also all done by me and it wasn't anyone elses work. 
        </p>

        <h5>Accessibility</h5>
        <p>
            I have addressed website accessibility in this project because the majority of my font sizes are bigger size. There aren't huge blocks of text that people could find hard to read and understand. If there are bigger parts of text they are in a bigger font so it isn't much writing it's just bigger. This font is also easier for people to read. I also have a navigation bar which is typical in websites so it will be easy for users to navigate around the website because none of it is in tech language. It is all in colours that people can read, either in black or white depending on which colour the box is.<br/>
            The navigation bar is clear the page links are on one side and the sign-in and log in are on the right-hand side which they typically are in websites so it is familiar with the users. I have very clear headings where there should be to make it easy for users to find and access. I also have an error page where it took the users to if there was an issue. This error page translated the issue into more basic words to users with no digital background could understand it. Since it took them to a separate page it made it clear to the user that there was a problem and having clear directions is super important for a website.
        </p>
        <h5>Aesthetics</h5>
        <p>
            I have addressed the aesthetics and relevant implications throughout this project by making the website look aesthetically pleasing for the type of people that will be going onto this website. Since it is for a Wellington queer youth association I made sure to style my website with lots of different colours, especially on the home page because each box has a separate colour and it goes down according to the rainbow. I have also put colourful pictures in there to add to the website theme.<br/>
            I have put the main picture up the top a photo I took of all the flags which is relevant for my website and is a nice basic picture. I also tried to incorporate rainbows where I could when styling the website including the buttons on the Meet the Team page so paying attention to detail during this was important. I also used the CRAP design method, which is an acronym for Contrast, Repetition, alignment, and then proximity, when focusing on the front end of the website because I had to be aware of the aesthetic relevant implications.
        </p>
        <h5>Future-proofing</h5>
        <p>
            I addressed this in my databases internal because I have commented throughout my code where I feel commenting is necessary. I did comment on my layout file because there are lots of elements and I made it clear if someone was to look at my code and understand it at a future time. I have a lot of different files and they are all in the same folder under templates and names correctly which corresponds to what file it is taking it to. This means it is much easier to find the file if someone wants to add to it in the future or if it came across errors it is easier to find.<br/>
            I have comments all throughout the files on my database just to say what each file is for and more on the news page because there are multiple different elements running from that file. I also have committed the site up to github multiple times so if someone wants to go back to previous places in the site then they can. 
        </p>
        <h5>Functionality</h5>
        <p>
            I have addressed this in my databases by making sure that everything works in my code and is connected to a database. This was especially relevant in my email database because I added in the code originally when creating my website and it was purely just there for aesthetic reasons. Then I remembered it was thereafter creating my other databases and linking the code on the front side to a database so it does do something. All of my databases work and if a user adds news or comments they appear on the website as well as in the database so we can see all of their additions.<br/>
            In my last sprint I focused on everything in my website being functional and not just caring about the look of the website. I went through and made sure everything worked and if there would be places where it could go wrong I fixed that.
